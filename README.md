# PNW Color Palette Package


I am soon moving away from the most beautiful place I will ever live, 
so I did what any nostalgic nature kid / data science nerd would do, 
and immortalized it in an R color palette package. Now I (and you!) can have the colors of Washington State and the 
Pacific Northwest live on in our presentation figures forever. 

All photos were taken by me in places that I love. The [Pantone Studio iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pantone-studio/id329515634) 
helped me extract palette colors, and
[Chroma.js Color Palette Helper](https://gka.github.io/palettes/#/9|s|00429d,96ffea,ffffe0|ffffe0,ff005e,93003a|1|1)
helped me  ensure that all palettes are color-blind safe to use for pretty and inclusive data viz.
